# Concept

React Most Wanted is based on **3 layers/shells**:

* **base-shell** - the base for every RMW project. It includes the management of \`Auth\` state, Internationalization state, the basic UI Layout and the routing
* **mui-shell** -  this layer includes the Material-UI design into base-shell with handy components like Page, a responsive Menu and settings for language
* **rmw-shell** - this layer includes all features from the previous ones and adds a integration to Firebase with it by providing handy tools to kick start a new React project with the full power of Firebase
